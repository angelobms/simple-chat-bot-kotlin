<h2>String templates</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>Sometimes, you need to put the values of <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/4371" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a variable is a storage for a value, which can be a string, a number, or something else. | Every variable has a name (or an identifier) to distinguish it from other variables. You can access a value by the name of the variable. Variables are one of the most often used elements in programming, so it is important to understand how to use them. Before you can start using a variable, you must declare it. To declare a variable, Kotlin provides two keywords: `val` and `var`.">variables</a> in a text. Luckily for you, Kotlin can help you with that using <strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/21438" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="A string template in Kotlin is a powerful tool for formatting strings, allowing for the insertion of variable or expression values directly into a string. | It is a convenient way to create dynamic strings, as it eliminates the need for manual string concatenation. String templates can be defined using double quotes, and the value of a variable or expression can be inserted using the $ operator. If the expression is more complex or involves object properties, curly braces can be used around the expression.">string templates</a></strong>. In this topic, we will discuss their purpose.</p><p>Suppose we need to display a message about today's temperature in Celsius:</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">The temperature in ... is ... degrees Celsius.</code></pre><p>Instead of <code class="language-kotlin">...</code> we need to display certain values.</p><p>If we have two variables <code class="language-kotlin">city</code> and <code class="language-kotlin">temp</code>, we can build the resulting string with concatenations:</p><pre><code class="language-kotlin">val city = "Paris"
val temp = "24"

println("The temperature in " + city + " is " + temp + " degrees Celsius.")</code></pre><p>It is a simple solution. But is it perfect? No. It's rather awkward.</p><p>Kotlin provides a more convenient way to do the same thing using string templates. How do they work? To add a variable value to a string, write the dollar sign <code class="language-kotlin">$</code> before a variable name:</p><pre><code class="language-kotlin">val city = "Paris"
val temp = "24"

println("The temperature in $city is $temp degrees Celsius.")</code></pre><p>The code becomes more readable. Both code snippets print the same message:</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">The temperature in Paris is 24 degrees Celsius.
</code></pre><p>If we do not want to print a string, we can create a variable:</p><pre><code class="language-kotlin">val value = "55"
val currency = "dollars"
val price = "$value $currency" // "55 dollars"
</code></pre><p>We recommend using string templates to build strings with variable values. Try using it instead of <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/12553" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, string concatenation is the process of combining two or more strings into a single string. | This is a common operation when working with strings and can be achieved using the '+' operator or the concatenation function. The resulting string from the concatenation will have the characters of all the strings combined in the order they were concatenated. It's important to note that strings in Kotlin are immutable, meaning that concatenation will always result in a new string and not modify the original strings.">string concatenation</a>.</p><h5 id="templates-for-expressions">Templates for expressions</h5><p>You can use string templates to put the result of an arbitrary expression in a string. To do that, include the entire expression in curly braces <code class="language-kotlin">{...}</code> after the dollar sign <code class="language-kotlin">$</code>. For example:</p><pre><code class="language-kotlin">val language = "Kotlin"
println("$language has ${language.length} letters in the name")</code></pre><p>It prints:</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Kotlin has 6 letters in the name</code></pre><p>Here <code class="language-kotlin">{language.length}</code> is an expression that will be evaluated. If you skip the braces, it will output something different:</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Kotlin has Kotlin.length letters in the name</code></pre><p>So, always use curly braces for expressions in string templates to avoid these mistakes. Do not add them if you want to output only a variable value even though it does work.</p><h5 id="idiom">Idiom</h5><p><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/8526" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, idiom refers to a set of commonly used patterns and conventions that are endorsed by the community. | These idiom help clarify the code for other developers and bring the code closer to the genuine Kotlin-style.
