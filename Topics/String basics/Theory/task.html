<h2>String basics</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>As you know, Kotlin has a lot of <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/4388" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, data types are a fundamental aspect of the language's type system, which includes various basic types that serve as building blocks for data manipulation. | Data types represent different kinds of data that can be stored and manipulated within a program. For instance, the `Int` data type represents a 32-bit signed integer, which can range from a minimum value of -2^31 to a maximum value of 2^31-1.">data types</a> such as <code class="language-kotlin">String</code>, <code class="language-kotlin">Int</code>, and <code class="language-kotlin">Double</code>. In this topic, we will focus on the <code class="language-kotlin">String</code> type. This is a very useful type as even a simple "Hello world!" program uses strings. A string is a sequence of zero or more <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/4680" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a character is a single symbol enclosed in single quotes. | It can represent any symbol, including letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits, and other special symbols. A character can also be represented by its hexadecimal code in the Unicode table, which starts with \u. Each character is a unique symbol, regardless of the sequence of characters used to represent its code. Additionally, characters can represent symbols from various alphabets, including hieroglyphs and other special symbols.">characters</a> enclosed by double quotes e.g. "John", "". You will surely use strings on a regular basis in your future projects. In this topic, we will look at some important basics of working with strings.</p><h5 id="the-length-of-a-string">The length of a string</h5><p>You will often need  to get the <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/10950" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, the length property is used to determine the number of characters in a string. | It is a read-only property, meaning it can only be accessed and not modified. The length is determined by the number of characters enclosed within the double quotes that define the string. This property is an integer value, representing the count of characters in the string. It is a fundamental property of the string data type and is widely used in various string manipulation operations.">length</a> of a <code class="language-kotlin">String</code>. The length of the string is determined by the number of characters that are enclosed between the double quotes. To do this, simply use <code class="language-kotlin">.length</code> which gives a value of the <code class="language-kotlin">Int</code> type:</p><pre><code class="language-kotlin">val language = "Kotlin"
println(language.length) // 6

val empty = ""

These operators have a predefined precedence and can be defined as member or extension functions with specific names for the corresponding type. The type for which the operator is defined becomes the left-hand side type for binary operations.">operation</a> with <code class="language-kotlin">String</code> is <strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/30909" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="Concatenation in Kotlin refers to the process of combining two or more strings into a single string. | This is a common operation when working with strings and is often used to build larger strings from smaller ones. The concatenation operator in Kotlin is the + symbol, which can be used to combine any two strings. When concatenating strings, the order of the strings matters, as the resulting string will be in the same order as the strings being combined.">concatenation</a></strong>. It is used to construct one string out of other strings.</p><p>Two strings can be concatenated with the <code class="language-kotlin">+</code>:</p><pre><code class="language-kotlin">val str1 = "ab"

val twelve = one + two 
println(one)      // 1, no changes
println(two)      // 2, no changes
println(twelve)   // 12</code></pre><p>You can concatenate multiple strings in the same expression:</p><pre><code class="language-kotlin">val firstName = "John"
val lastName = "Smith"
val fullName = firstName + " " + lastName</code></pre><p></p><div class="alert alert-warning"><p>Pay attention<strong>, </strong><code class="language-kotlin">str1 + str2</code> is not the same as <code class="language-kotlin">str2 + str1</code> because the concatenation is not a commutative operation, unlike addition.</p></div><p></p><h5 id="appending-values-to-strings">Appending values to strings</h5><p>The <code class="language-kotlin">+</code> also works for appending values of different types to a <code class="language-kotlin">String</code>. The value is automatically converted to a <code class="language-kotlin">String</code> and then concatenated to the target <code class="language-kotlin">String</code>:</p><pre><code class="language-kotlin">val stringPlusBoolean = "abc" + 10 + true
println(stringPlusBoolean) // abc10true

val code = "123" + 456 + "789"
println(code) // 123456789</code></pre><p></p><div class="alert alert-warning"><p>An expression must start with a <code class="language-kotlin">String</code>.</p></div><p></p><p>Take a look at the example below. It wouldn't work because the first operand is a number:</p><pre><code class="language-kotlin">val errorString = 10 + "abc" // an error here!</code></pre><p>Let's consider a different situation:</p><pre><code class="language-kotlin">val stringAndNumbers = "abc" + 11 + 22
println(stringAndNumbers) // abc1122</code></pre><p>Why did that work? First, it appends <code class="language-kotlin">11</code> to the string <code class="language-kotlin">"abc"</code>, and then it appends <code class="language-kotlin">22</code> to the string <code class="language-kotlin">"abc11"</code>.</p><p>You may concatenate a character with a <code class="language-kotlin">String</code> to get a new <code class="language-kotlin">String</code>:</p><pre><code class="language-kotlin">val charPlusString = 'a' + "bc"
println(charPlusString) // abc
val stringPlusChar = "de" + 'f'
println(stringPlusChar) // def</code></pre><p>Also, you may append any value to the result, because characters plus a string gives you a <code class="language-kotlin">String</code>:</p><pre><code class="language-kotlin">val charPlusStringPlusInt = 'a' + "bc" + 123
println(charPlusStringPlusInt) // abc123</code></pre><p>We will discuss how to work with characters later, but for now, just remember that you can concatenate characters and strings to get a <code class="language-kotlin">String</code> value.

You can perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus with integer variables.
